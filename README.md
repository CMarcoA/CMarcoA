## Currently 
- Getting more and more into **UI** and nerding out on the psychology behind why people click
- Messing around with **Robotics** ultimate goal: a pancake bot that flips better than me :neckbeard:

- Getting more active in Githib, buiding projects, and contributing (working on it 😄)
- Building a habit to problem solve (Leetcode ? hopefully 🤔)
