## Hi i'm Marco 👋 a Computer Science Undergrade @ UofManitoba

## Currently 
- Nerding out more and more into **UI**
- Messing around with **Robotics** ultimate goal: a pancake bot that flips better than me :neckbeard:

- Getting more active in Github, buiding projects, and contributing (working on it 😄)
- Building a habit to problem solve (Leetcode ? hopefully 🤔)
